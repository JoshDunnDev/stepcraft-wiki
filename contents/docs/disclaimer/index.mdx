## Important notice

This wiki started with an initial set of pages generated by Artificial Intelligence. While this helped us cover many sections quickly, there may be **incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information**.

Our goal is for this wiki to be a living, reliable reference for the game’s current state. To achieve that, we **rely on the volunteer work of the community** — players, testers, and contributors who keep pages up to date.

## How you can help

- Review pages you’re familiar with and fix any incorrect information.
- Add recent details after game updates and patches.
- Fill in missing sections (recipes, locations, stats, mechanics, etc.).
- Report inconsistencies by leaving feedback or opening a PR.

## Reporting and contributing

- To edit this or any page, use the “Edit page” link on the right-hand side.
- Read the contribution guide here: [How to Contribute](/docs/how-to-contribute).

Thank you for helping make the wiki more useful and accurate for everyone.
